## How to Use

After you've launched the application, you'll see a user interface where you can upload a video file, adjust a threshold slider for slide extraction, and a button to begin the extraction and conversion process.

2.  Adjust the Threshold slider to optimize slide extraction. A higher threshold will result in fewer extracted slides.
3.  Press "Convert" to begin the extraction and conversion process.
